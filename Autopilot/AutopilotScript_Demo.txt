print 'Start Script'

if(ReceivedSignal):
	Script.ChangeMode("Guided")

#Notes: 
# Do we need more information for "Guided" mode to work? See other example for how that might look. 
# How to do received signal? Some ideas:
#	Script.GetParam(chx1in) - returns an input channel. Possibly could hook up the arduino differently?
#	Script.WaitFor(string, timeout) - I can't find good examples of how this is used, but if there 
#					is an sBus command that we will not use and will not do anything, 
#					perhaps the arduino could send that signal?
# 	Another GetParam - Is there any other variable that would indicate we are released from the rocket?
